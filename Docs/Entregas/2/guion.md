## Greetings

Good morning/evening!  Welcome to the presentation What’s new Hunnigan?

## Slides Content
This presentation includes the adjustments and advances in the Hunnigan project such as the plan modification, the verification and validation improvement, new specified visual designs and the implementation progress.

## Plan adjustments 
We had some modifications in the duration of the project phases, specifically on the sprints number two, three and four, this is due to an indication from our client in which the delivery date was postponed, thus producing a lengthening of the project plan and development in general. All these changes can be seen on our Github repository.

## Case of use -> acceptance criteria 
In the beginning we planned to use cases of use to define the requirements for our product, but we found out that we needed a better approach to our method; thus, after meetings between the Product Owner and the Client and considering several options we decided to adopt a Human-Based Specified Acceptance Criteria for a more efficient V&V process.

## Design advances that lead us to Implementation 
Now, the design advances that lead us to start the implementation, comprehend our first specification, the static, low-fidelity and colorless wireframe that you can see at the left side of the slide; this conceptual sketch allowed us to create a more visual and dynamical prototype. It is considered to use this prototype to develop the GUI of the final product, in the implementation phase.

## Implementation advances
As you can see in the media exposed in this slide, at the moment our product Hunnigan Bot is able to create NOTES with a “Name : Content” composition, as well as to consult all the NOTES already created.

## Individual contribution

We are a very proactive team, and we needed a technique to determine individual contribution. 
As a result we defined a formula to measure it, and an amazing notice is that the project activities were distributed and done very equitatively.
