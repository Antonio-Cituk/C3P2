# GUIÓN

## WELCOME

Hello everyone, we are C3P2 Team. Our project´s name is Hunnigan.

## OBJECTIVES

We expect in this project to develop a tool that will help students & professors to make, share and review class notes. This tool will make “class notes taking” efficient and enjoyable.

## PROPOSAL

It is Hunnigan, and he will take care of your notes in an efficient and organized way.

## PROCESS

Our process is an adaptation of  three different project management methods; SCRUM, KANBAN and Incremental method. It is divided in 6 Steps, the first one is the collection of user requirements, we call this the Product Backlog, then comes the Sprint Planning, where we take the most prioritized requirements from the Product Backlog list to develop them during the Hacking or implementation step;
 Here comes our favorite part of the development, the sprint progress review with the personal & development retrospective, where we review Hacking progress, in these weekly reunions make comments or opinions about our contribution performance and personal obstacles. The last section of the sprint is the Sprint Review, in this step we converge the results of the activities from the sprint and conclude to begin the next Sprint. As you can see, on the bottom right corner, there is a box with “Product incrementation” caption, 

What do we consider as Product Incrementation?
The Product Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. The Increment must be “Done,” which means it must be in usable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done”. 

## ROLES

The last process explained needs to be managed by three types of roles, first, Esteban as the product owner who works as client proxy to make the system requirements relate to the client requirements.

Then, Antonio, our Scrum master, our process guide and team leader who monitorize and increments the productivity of the team.
and the most valuable the Development team who encourages to make the project a real thing!

## PLANNING
> ¿what  are we going to do to achieve it? 

Let´s see!
Our planning unfolds in four main sprints which start from research for our product in sprint number one, until its layout.
Architecture design, organization of information and presentation to the user are specified in sprint number two and three; and concludes on sprint number four, which specifies the implementation of amazing features!

## TEAMWORK 

¿How do we manage to work collaboratively?
There we have two important aspects:
The repository that we use as a location for the documentation and data of the  project.
The individual contribution metrics that is made as a percentage calculation of the documental contribution, meetings presence and the accomplishment of agreed activities.

## SUBJECT COMPETENCES
> Expected competences for software engineering 
  
With this project with expect to gain certain subject competences
First, the general competences are being developed through the implementation of different methods and philosophies of software development such as Scrum. On the other hand, the specific competences occur naturally because each part of the development process is an adaptation from an established methodology of software engineering.

## THANKS & FINISH
